There are two tables, one is credit card information and the other is credit card to account 
reference data. 

Credit card information is snapshot data. 

| card_number | card_holder | last_bill_date | extract_date |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| C1          | abcd        | 2005-06-06     | 2017-05-05   |
| C1          | abcd        | 2005-06-06     | 2017-05-06   |
| C1          | abcd        | 2005-06-01     | 2017-05-07   |
| C2          | defg        | 2005-06-03     | 2017-05-07   |
| C2          | defg        | 2005-06-03     | 2017-05-08   |
| C3          | efgh        | 2005-06-03     | 2017-05-08   |

Card to Account mapping

| card_number | account_number | 
|-------------|----------------|
| C1          | A1        | 
| C2          | A2        | 


The requirement is to join these two tables on `card_number` and write output keyed on
account number. There should be only one row for an account in output, and it should first
occurance of that account information by `extract_date`. 

output

| account_number | card_holder | last_bill_date | extract_date |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| A1             | abcd        | 2005-06-06     | 2017-05-05   |
| A2             | defg        | 2005-06-03     | 2017-05-07   |
